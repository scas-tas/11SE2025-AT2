## Assessment Task 2 â€“ Programming Portfolio: OOP Retro Game

Welcome to your personal project repository for AT2. This repo contains **skeleton code** to help you get started on your own Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) retro-style game.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Task Overview

Your goal is to explore OOP principles by building or adapting a small retro game in Python. You must apply good programming practices, customisation, and documentation.

Choose one of the three pathways:

### Pathway 1: Customise an existing Python OOP game  
Find a game tutorial or template in Python that uses OOP. Modify features like scoring, collisions, graphics, player abilities, or levels.

### Pathway 2: Translate a non-Python OOP game into Python  
Find source code for a game built with OOP in another language (e.g. Java, C#, etc). Rebuild it in Python using your own class structure and customisations.

### Pathway 3: Code an OOP game from scratch (advanced â€“ seek approval)  
Start from a blank slate in Python or another language, building your game using original classes, methods, and features.

## Skeleton Code Provided

Your repo includes a few basic files to get started:
- `main.py`: The entry point for your game
- `player.py`: A starting class for your main character
- `obstacle.py`: A base class for obstacles (e.g. cars, logs)
- `game_manager.py`: Manages the game state and flow
- `assets/`: Place for images, sounds, etc.
- `docs/`: You can place diagrams or notes here (optional)

You are free to **delete, rename, or restructure** any of the provided files to suit your chosen approach.

## âœ… What You Should Be Doing in This Repo

- Write clean, readable code using appropriate class structures
- Use clear and consistent naming for variables, methods, and files
- Comment your code where needed
- Commit your changes regularly with meaningful commit messages
- Track your progress and test often

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started Tips
- You can run this project in **PyCharm** or any other Python IDE that connects to Git
- Remember that you're the first Year 11 class to attempt GitHub Classroom at SCAS so we are learning as we go
  (but using GitHub actually makes your code more secure than just coding locally on your laptop)
- Ask your teacher or classmates for help if you're stuck!

Happy coding!
